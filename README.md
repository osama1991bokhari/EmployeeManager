This is a project that is required by my company, it is a simple java program that will store and manage the employees that
are working on different projects and storing their data on a derby database.

For now the program has a simple account management interface and is able to add, edit, delete and query employees with different criteria

There are three different types of users for the program
1. Admin: has the highest authoritise, can add and remove users
2. Editer: has the ability to add, edit, remove and query employees
3. Viewer: only can query employees
